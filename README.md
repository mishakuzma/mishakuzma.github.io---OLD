# mishakuzma.github.io

Welcome to my personal website, created using CSS and W3CSS to be responsive.

This is meant to replace mishakuzma.weebly.com

Please let me know of any issues you have with it.

Todo: 
- Get screenshots of projects for grid table
- Use CSS for hover-colour on screenshots
- Develop project websites for each project
